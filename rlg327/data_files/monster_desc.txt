NAME Junior Barbarian
SYMB p
COLOR YELLOW
DESC
This is a junior barbarian.  He--or is it she?  You can't tell for sure--
looks like... it should still be in barbarian school.  The barbarians are 
putting them in the dungeons young these days.  It's wearing dirty, tattered
cloth armor and wielding a wooden sword.  You have a hard time feeling
intimidated.

NAME Amazon Lich Queen
DESC
She was a powerful Amazon warrior in life.  Death at the hands of the undead
hordes was followed by her resurrection through dark, necromantic arts.  Her
power in life didn't approach her undead glory.  Clad in night-black robes
that don't move in the wind, her incorporeal form commands the power of death
over life.  You may just be her next victim.  You fear for your soul as you
quake before her malevolent majesty.

NAME Rory Gilmore
DESC
All decked out in a brand new Chilton uniform, she talks faster than anybody
you've ever known.  She's dual-wielding Proust's "Rememberance of Things
Past" and a half-empty coffee cup; you'd better watch out or she'll hit you
with a litany of cultural references from which you'll never recover.

NAME Casper the Friendly Ghost
DESC
Casper, the friendly ghost, 
The friendliest ghost you know. 
Though grown-ups might 
Look at him with fright, 
The children all love him so. 

He always says hello, 
and he's really glad to meetcha. 
Wherever he may go, 
He's kind to every living creature. 

Grown-ups don't understand 
Why children love him the most. 
But kids all know 
That he loves them so, 
Casper the friendly ghost.
